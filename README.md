# RNN-Lib
In this repository i have build RNN and LSTM from scratch using numpy only. I am open sourcing it so that anyone can use it in their project. This is a simple RNN & LSTM architechture where all the input length is equal to the output length i.e, T_x=T_y.
### Dependencies:
  * python
  * numpy
